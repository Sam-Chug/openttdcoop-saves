# OpenTTDCoop Save Repository
OpenTTD is an open source transport simulation game based on Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe ([Github Repository](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD))

OpenTTDCoop is a team of experienced players who worked together to create transportation networks that stretched the limits of the game engine. ([Open TTD Coop wiki](https://wiki.openttdcoop.org/Main_Page))

The OpenTTDCoop team was active from 2005-2019 and produced over 300 game saves, all of which are available for download on the OpenTTDCoop wiki, though the download server for said gamesaves is finicky at best. This repository aims to archive every Coop save and host them as reliable download source.
